# Smart Study Planner

A simple web app that helps students organize study tasks by priority and due date, and suggests what to study next.

## Features

- Add tasks with title, subject, due date, estimated hours, and priority.
- See all tasks in a sortable table.
- Highlight tasks by priority (High / Medium / Low).
- Filter tasks by **All**, **Today**, **This week**, or **Overdue**.
- Mark tasks as done or delete them.
- “What to study next” suggestion based on nearest deadline and highest priority.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML** – Structure of the planner UI.
- **CSS** – Card layout, responsive table, and priority badges.
- **JavaScript** – Task logic, filtering, and suggestion.
- **localStorage** – Saves tasks in the browser so they persist across reloads.
